# Eggs Hemingway
This is a simplified version since I'm not using hollandaise sauce, instead using a flavored compound butter and relying on the poached egg yolk to be enough yolk. 

Idea is from [Chef John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHEl5sUebhk) but I use homemade biscuits instead of English muffins.
