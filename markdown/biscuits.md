# Buttermilk biscuits
This is a simplified recipe that is inspired from Adam Ragusea's. I don't remember which video I based the recipe on but both are good to watch for visual cues.

## Supplies 
* 1 measuring cup
* 1 tablespoon
* 1 teaspoon
* Mixing bowl (bonus points if it's cold from sitting in the freezer)
* Baking tray
* Parchment paper
            
## Ingredients
* 2 cup flour
* 1 stick butter
* 5 tbsp cornstarch
* 1 heaping tbsp baking powder 
* 1 tsp salt 
* 2 tsp sugar
* 1 cup buttermilk, cold (obv you wouldn't use warm lol but keep it in fridge until last second)

## Steps
* Preheat oven to like 475ish. (I keep increasing it 5 degrees each time I do this lol)
* Mix **2 cups flour**, **5 tbsp cornstarch**, **1 heaping tbsp baking powder**, **1 tsp salt**, and **2 tsp sugar**)
* Grate **1 stick frozen butter** right inside the mixing bowl. Tap the box grater to make sure not too much is sticking to the sides (some definitely will; it's fine)
* Mix the butter with the flour mixture.
* Put in freezer for 15 minutes while oven preheats (Don't skip this!!! I did once and it was bad. We really don't want the butter to melt before it bakes)
* Barely mix in **1 cup buttermilk**. It’s okay if there’s still some flour in the bowl because you can use that for the next step!
* Mold it into a big lump, flour the surface, and roll it out to an inch thick. Flour the top, fold it over on itself, and roll it out again. Repeat for a total of seven folds. I always lose count, though.
* Cut out biscuits, probably squares to minimize trimmings
* Put the biscuits on a parchment-lined baking sheet. They won't expand outward so you'll be fine as long as they're not touching.
* Brush the tops with melted butter with a pastry brush. I always forget to do this step too
* Bake until puffy and golden, about 15 minutes.
* Take off baking sheet immediately so bottoms don't burn

## Variants
* Use whole wheat flour if you want sad biscuits that aren't that good
* Bake on racks if you want them to envelop the racks on both sides sorta like kebabs and be annoying to get off
