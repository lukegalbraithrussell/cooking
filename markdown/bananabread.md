# Chocolate chip banana bread
Courtesy of my mother, original recipe from a Marcia Woehlbrandt, 1981. I've rounded measurements because accuracy is for competent people.

## Supplies 
* 1 bundt pan or, 5 small loaf pans (I do the latter)
* a large mixing bowl
* a whisk and biceps of steel, or a hand mixer
* 10 fingers or a wooden spoon
* 1 tsp 
* 1/2 cup measuring cup
* 1/3 cup measuring cup
            
## Ingredients
* 1 stick + 3 tbsp softened butter
* 5/3 cup sugar
* 1 glug vanilla
* 3 eggs 
* 2/3 cup buttermilk
* 3 ripe bananas

* 5/2 cup flour
* 1 heaping tsp baking soda
* 1 heaping tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt

* 1 cup chopped walnuts
* 1 cup chocolate chips

## Steps
* preheat oven to 350 (325 convection)
* cream **1 stick + 3 tbsp butter** and **5/3 cup sugar**
* bash **3 bananas** up, with your hands or a wooden spoon I guess if you're not feeling primal
* add in **glug vanilla**, bananas, and **1/3 cup buttermilk** (half of the total buttermilk) and mix well
* add **1 heaping tsp baking soda**, **1 heaping tsp baking powder**, **1 tsp salt**, and **5/2 cup flour** blend well
* add **3 eggs** and remaining **1/3 cup buttermilk**, mix well
* add **1 cup walnuts** and **1 cup chocolate chips**, blend by hand
* butter and flour pans to prevent sticking (OR use the crumpled-up parchment paper trick)
* pour batter into pans
* bake: 50 - 55 minutes for bundt pan, 40 - 45 minutes for the small loaf pans
* freeze any you won't eat in a few days

## Variants
* You can leave out the walnuts. I never put in walnuts. Who owns walnuts??
