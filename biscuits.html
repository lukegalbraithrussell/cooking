                # Buttermilk biscuits
                
                This is a simplified recipe that is inspired from Adam Ragusea's videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhXLxDctHL8) and [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZkeXyUTRfc)). I don't remember which video I based the recipe on but both are good to watch for visual cues.
                
                ## Supplies 
                * 1 measuring cup
                * 1 T
                * 1 t
                * Mixing bowl (bonus points if it's cold from sitting in the freezer)
                * Baking tray
                * Parchment paper
                            
                ## Ingredients
                * 2 cup flour
                * 1 stick butter
                * 5 tbsp cornstarch
                * 1 heaping tbsp baking powder 
                * 1 t salt 
                * 2 t sugar
                * 1 cup buttermilk, cold (obv you wouldn't use warm lol but keep it in fridge until last second)
                
                ## Steps
                1. Preheat oven to like 475ish. (I keep increasing it 5 degrees each time I do this lol)
                1. Mix **2 cups flour**, **5 tbsp cornstarch**, **1 heaping tbsp baking powder**, **1 t salt**, and **2 t sugar**)
                1. Grate **1 stick frozen butter** right inside the mixing bowl. Tap the box grater to make sure not too much is sticking to the sides (some definitely will; it's fine)
                1. Mix the butter with the flour mixture.
                1. Put in freezer for 15 minutes while oven preheats (Don't skip this!!! I did once and it was bad. We really don't want the butter to melt before it bakes)
                1. Barely mix in **1 cup buttermilk**. It’s okay if there’s still some flour in the bowl because you can use that for the next step!
                1. Mold it into a big lump, flour the surface, and roll it out to an inch thick. Flour the top, fold it over on itself, and roll it out again. Repeat for a total of seven folds. I always lose count, though.
                1. Cut out biscuits, probably squares to minimize trimmings
                1. Put the biscuits on a parchment-lined baking sheet. They won't expand outward so you'll be fine as long as they're not touching.
                1. Brush the tops with melted butter with a pastry brush. I always forget to do this step too
                1. Bake until puffy and golden, about 15 minutes.
                1. Take off baking sheet immediately so bottoms don't burn
                
                ## Variants
                * Use whole wheat flour if you want sad biscuits that aren't that good
                * Bake on racks if you want them to envelop the racks on both sides sorta like kebabs and be annoying to get off
