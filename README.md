Here is my collection of cooking recipes. I keep them here for easy access and to have a link when someone wants a recipe.

This is a bad site. It is a mess of poorly written HTML. 

It is also poorly written in the more literal sense.

One of these days I'll migrate this to a nice site generator and actually write words good here. 

But for now, enjoy mediocre words talking about sorta-mediocre food.

## Bug!

You can't close out the modal for banana bread. Dunno why, you just can't. Just refresh the page pls.
