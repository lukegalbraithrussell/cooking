                # French toast with strawberry whipped cream

                This is version 16 of my attempt to make french toast in a way that reminds me of [Sassy Onion](https://www.sassyonion.com) and [Word of Mouth](https://ilovewom.com/), both in Salem, Oregon.
                
                ## Supplies 
                * mixing bowl
                * knife
                * 1-cup measuring cup
                * baking sheet
                * whisk or beater
                * nonstick pan, or one of those huge griddles if your family doesn't practice birth control
                * flipper
                * a pie pan, or other flat surface that will hold liquid
                * 1 oven-safe cooling rack 
                            
                ## Ingredients
                _Honestly I eyeball everything except the buttermilk and eggs. That's the only ratio that needs to stay consistent_
                
                * 1 cup buttermilk
                * 3 eggs
                * 1 swish of vanilla
                * 1 loaf of challah bread (brioche works too)
                * 1/4 stick of butter
                * 1 tsp salt
                * 1 cup crushed cornflakes
                * 1/2 - 1 cup cream
                * 1 8oz package of strawberries
                * a few spoonfuls of sugar
                
                ## Steps
                
                ### French toast
                
                #### Day before
                * cut off all the crust of **1 loaf of challah bread** with bread knife. 
                * cut bread into 1 inch thick slices (or half slices!)
                * leave bread out to stale (alternatively, put toast in oven while it preheats the next day)
                
                #### Mise en place
                * Heat oven to 350
                * Put cooling rack on baking sheet, and put in oven. If you don't have a cooling rack, just place baking sheet below one of the oven's racks
                * Pour **1 cup of cornflakes** on plate. Crush cornflakes with your fists or something heavy. A plastic bag can contain the mess but it'll usually tear anyway so I just crush them over the plate
                * Whisk together **1 cup buttermilk**, **3 eggs**, **1 swish vanilla**, and **1 tsp salt** in pie pan
                
                #### The show
                You'll be repeating these steps until you've used up all your slices
                
                * Dip slice in mixture for ~5 minutes each side, flip and repeat
                * Dredge bread in crushed cornflakes
                * Fry toast on pan in medium low heat, **1 tablespoon of butter** until golden brown on each side. I also like to hit the edges like I'm searing a steak but that probably doesn't do anything
                * Store in oven until ready (If it's a suuuuper long wait maybe turn off the oven)
                
                I lowkey think these are better the next day when you reheat them in the toaster oven, the butter smells even better somehow
                
                ### Whipped cream
                Do this once all your french toast is done and in the oven - this'll only take a few minutes
                * Dice **1 8oz package of strawberries**; I like slicing some of them so each one is a circle because they look like flowers
                * Add **a few spoonfuls sugar** if the strawberries are too tart; the earlier you do this the more juices will be drawn out which will make the whipped cream more pink
                * Put **1/2 - 1 cup cream** in (preferably cold) mixing bowl
                * Mix cream for a few minutes in cold mixing bowl until medium(???) peaks form. I think it should technically be stiff peaks, but I always overwhip it, so I try to undershoot it.
                * Fold strawberries into whipped cream. Do it gently so there are pretty red streaks. (Thoroughly mixing them won't turn the whipped cream pink, the red will just be absorbed)
                
                ## Variants
                
                * Use tongs if you like crushing your french toast
                * Use cream instead of buttermilk to cut down on ingredients to purchase! 
                * If you only have enough cream for the whipped cream, and no buttermilk, 1 cup of milk + 1 tbps of something acidic (vinegar or lemon juice) will get you there
                * Use panko bread crumbs if you want something *incredibly* crunchy. I love me some crisp french toast, but this method from Adam Ragusea was just too much for me
