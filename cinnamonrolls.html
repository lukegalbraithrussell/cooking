* whisk
* 1/3 cup measure
* 1/4 cup measure
* a ramekin to put the egg in to YOINK the yolk out
* a ramekin to melt butter in
* 1/2 tspn measure, or contentness with just using a few pinches
* 1 tbspn measure
* baking sheet with parchment paper
            
## Ingredients
### Dough
* bread flour, about two cups
* 1/3 cup milk
* 1 packet instant dry yeast
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1 egg
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* small glug of vanilla

### Filling
* 1/3 cup brown sugar
* small pinch of salt
* 1 tbsp melted butter
* 1 tbsp ground cinnamon

### Marshmallow glaze
* 1 egg white (leftover from the dough)
* 1/3 cup sugar
* a squeeze of corn syrup
* 1 tablespoon butter
* a glug of vanilla

## Steps

### Dough
1. Warm the **1/3 cup milk** to body temperature in microwave, ~20 seconds
1. Stir in the **1 packet instant dry yeast** and let bloom
1. Melt **2 tbsp butter** in microwave, ~15 seconds.
1. Combine butter with **1/4 cup sugar**, **1/2 tsp salt** and **glug of vanilla** 
1. Separate the egg in ramekin, add yolk to butter mixture
1. Add as much flour as you can easily stir into the milk mixture with a spoon (**~3/4 cup**)
1. Add flour to butter mixture until it's a paste (**~1/2 cup**)
1. Let sit for a half hour. Milk dough will have puffed up
1. Combine the two doughs. If it's too dry, add a little bit more milk. If it's more than just a little sticky, add flour
1. Put in oven that you had on for a few minutes (so it's just a little warmer than the house) and let rise for a few hours

### Filling
1. Melt **1 tbsp butter**
1. Combine **1/3 cup brown sugar**, **1 tbsp cinnamon** with butter. We're going for damp sand here. 
1. Roll out dough until about an inch thick. Make one edge thin.
1. Melt **1 tbsp butter**
1. Brush dough with some of the melted butter. Leave the thin edge alone
1. Spread sand-like mixture over dough. Keep leaving the thin edge alone
1. Brush water on thin edge
1. Roll up the dough, with the thin edge being the end. Make sure the thin edge is the bottom 
1. Cover with remaining butter

### The show
You could do everything before this the night before.
1. Slice the roll into individual pieces  
1. place on parchment-lined baking sheet 
1. Let them rise for a half hour again
1. Bake at 400ÂºF for 10 minutes

### Marhsmallow glaze
1. whisk together **1 egg white**, **1/3 cup sugar** and **squeeze of corn syrup** over medium heat. It'll turn white and thick in like 5 minutes
1. Pull of heat, and whisk in **1 tbsp butter**. It's monter au beurre time
1. Add **glug of vanilla** 
1. Dip not-super-hot rolls face-up in glaze
